# DataScience-Algorithms-From-Scratch

In this repository I am going to Write DataScience and machine learning algorithms from scratch.

    1) Linear Regression:
        In the lenear regression we find out the best fit line from the data points.
        the equestion of best fit line is:
            Y = mX + C
            where: 
                Y is y-coordinator.
                X is x-coordinator.
                m is Slope of the line.
                C is y-axis intercept.
                
        
    
    
    2 Logistic Regression.
    3 Linear Discriminant Analysis.
    4 Classification and Regression Trees.
    5 Naive Bayes.
    6 K-Nearest Neighbors.
    7 Learning Vector Quantization.
    8 Support Vector Machines.
